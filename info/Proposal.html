        <h2>
        Problem<br>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Unemployment, this is a problem that only grows the greater society grows; <br>
        old methods serve no purpose anymore, and newer methods are taking people’s <br>
        jobs away. So what can we do? We shouldn’t look forward, we shouldn’t look <br>
        backwards, we must step sideways and think outside the box.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>
        Strategic Goal<br>
        </h2>
        <p>
        To help the community have access to different jobs in the main segment, <br>
        newborn students with the difficulty of finding work, facilitate the search <br>
        and the objective.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>
        Methodology<br>
        </h2>
        
            <li>Understand the problem by contacting people who either live it or see it every day.</li>
              <li>Ask for what the client(s) would like the web page to have. (Requirements).</li>
                <li>Make prototypical designs following carefully the requirements. (Software Design).</li>
                  <li>Get validation of the best prototype by the client or go back to step three. (Design Validation).</li>
                    <li>Start developing back-end (Source Code).</li>
                      <li>Work out the functions the user will be able to access (front-end) (Integration).</li>
                        <li>Lookout for errors in the system and correcting them (Debugging).</li>
                          <li>Show software to client and explain how it works and how he can control it. <br>
                              If he wants a slight change, go back to step 5. (Validation).</li>
                            <li>Give product to client (Delivery).</li>
